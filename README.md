Pixelapse Toolbelt: Companies' Color
===============

This is the database of the colors for the companies in our [Toolbelt/Color](http://toolbelt.pixelapse.com/color). Feel free to add your company to it!

##Adding a company

1. Fork this branch

2. Fill in the template below and append it to the end of `colordata.json`.
  * At the very least, you need to have `name`, `url-web` and one `colors-primary`
  * Colors should be in hexadecimal format without '#' symbol
  * Bonus points for tracking down their elusive branding guidelines page
  * Remember to add commas to the trailing } of the company before your's!

  ```
    {
      "name": "",
      "url-brand": "",
      "url-web": "",
      "url-logo": "logos/",
      "year-start": "",
      "year-end": "",
      "notes": "",
      "colors-primary": [
        ""
      ],
      "colors-secondary": [
        ""
      ]
    }
  ```

3. Find a high-resolution image of the company's logo and include it in `logos` folder. PNG and SVG are preferred over JPEG.

4. Submit a pull request!
